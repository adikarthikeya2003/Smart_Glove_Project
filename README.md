# Sign_Detection_Smart_Glove_Project
This study focuses on the development of a Sign Recognition Smart Glove
tailored to assist individuals who are deaf and mute. The smart glove
incorporates advanced sensor technologies and Embedded C algorithms to
interpret and translate gestures into text or speech in real-time. The primary
objective is to provide a seamless communication bridge between the deaf
and mute community and the general populace, thereby fostering inclusivity
and accessibility. The research methodology involves the integration of flex
sensors, microcontrollers, and Bluetooth modules within the glove to
capture and analyze hand movements and gestures. These data are then
processed through a microcontroller unit, which recognizes and interprets
the gestures accurately.

The Sign Recognition Smart Glove is designed to be user-friendly,
lightweight, and non-intrusive, facilitating ease of use for individuals with
varying dexterity. Furthermore, the system aims to be adaptable to different
regional sign languages, making it inclusive for a global user base. The
study also addresses the ethical considerations and user acceptance through
field trials and user feedback, ensuring that the smart glove aligns with the
cultural and social needs of the target user group. The potential impact of
the Sign Recognition Smart Glove extends beyond individual users to
educational institutions, public service sectors, and social interactions,
fostering greater integration and understanding for the deaf and mute
community.

Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of assistive
technologies by leveraging modern sensor and machine learning
technologies to create a practical and empowering tool for individuals with
hearing and speech impairments.
